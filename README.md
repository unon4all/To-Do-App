# To-Do App with Jetpack Compose and MVVM

Welcome to the To-Do App! This project is a simple yet powerful To-Do application built using Jetpack Compose and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. The app demonstrates best practices in Android development with a focus on modern, declarative UI design and a clear separation of concerns.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Keep track of completed tasks.
- **Persist Data**: All tasks are saved locally on the device using Room database.

## Architecture

This project follows the MVVM architecture pattern, which helps to keep the code organized and maintainable. Here's a high-level overview of the architecture:

- **Model**: Represents the data layer. In this project, it consists of the Room database and data entities.
- **View**: The UI layer, built with Jetpack Compose.
- **ViewModel**: Manages the UI-related data and handles the communication between the View and Model.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: The programming language used.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
- **MVVM**: Architectural pattern used to separate the UI from the business logic.
- **Room**: Persistence library for local data storage.
- **Hilt**: Dependency Injection library to manage dependencies.
